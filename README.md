## Google Drive Client
**This is a university project** 

I created a frontend client for the Google Drive API to make managing files and folders more intuitive and user-friendly. This application supports secure login with OAuth 2.0, drag-and-drop uploads, and simple folder creation. It also includes a fast search feature, easy folder navigation, and the ability to delete files and folders efficiently.
